    "## Execution Model - Introductory\n",
    "Okay, I want you to pay real close attention to this part, as it VITAL to understanding how parallel computing works - and in turn, how we can optimize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads\n",
    "Threads are the smallest unit of execution - imagine them as mini workers inside a computer chip, each handling one small task at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are different from threads. They are independent programs in execution, and threads live inside processes (hence, smallest). Think of a process as a team, and the threads as the mini workers in that team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes are independent because each of them has its own memory space, while threads in the same process share the same memory space. This is why one process crashing does not affect other processes, but one thread crashing can bring down the entire process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cores\n",
    "Cores are the physical execution units in a processor that run threads.\n",
    "\n",
    " Each core can technically only execute one thread at a time but since threads are so small, that execution slice is extremely brief, and the CPU rapidly switches between them -- thousands of times per second. This time-slicing creates the illusion that many threads are running simaltaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Small interactive exercise for you:** Click off this guide and go check how many cores your CPU has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Got it? Great. So, your CPU having X cores means technically only X threads are *truly* running at any given moment, and the rest are just taking turns so quickly that you don't notice. So your Chrome browser, VSCode, and Riot Client are all juggling threads -- pausing one task for a fraction of a millisecond to let another run, then switching back.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also your mighty X cores? Sit down for this one. \n",
    "A state-of-the-art GPU (RTX 4090) has upwards of 16,000 CUDA cores. These CUDA cores don't time-slice threads like CPU cores, though -- they keep thousands of threads active truly at the same time. This is where the limitations of CPUs, and the domination of GPUs for massively parallel workloads come into play\n",
    "\n",
    "### Blocks\n",
    "Blocks are groups of threads that work together in a GPU. Threads in the same block have access to a shared memory region (SMEM) using fast on-chip shared memory -- this is crucual for optimization tricks we'll see later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are enjoying the workers analogy - a block can be thought of as a bigger department of mini workers, all of whom are in the same office, able to talk to each other and use the departments shared tools and resources. However, our poor mini workers are under a cruel corporation, and they cannot directly talk to workers in other departments ~ **Threads in different blocks cannot share memory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grids\n",
    "Grids are collections of blocks launched for the kernel. More precisely, when each kernel is launched (invoked) it creates a single grid, which has a user-defined number of blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid would be the entire building of the coorporation, with many different departments of mini workers, who are under strict command to not talk to each other\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keep reading and you will be illuminated to how these all tie in together."

    "If I haven't mentioned yet (I actually have not), a **kernel** is a function written in CUDA that runs on the GPU, executed by many threads in parallel\n",
    "\n",
    "<sub> You might be thinking of \"kernels\" in a different context, especially because of how intertwined they are with processes and cores. Let me stop you right there. This is a very common misconception. You would be thinking of OS kernels, which is a core component of an OS, responsible for managing symtem resources. These have **NOTHING** to do with the CUDA kernels we are focusing on. </sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "CUDA kernels run on the GPU, but are launched (similar to a function call) from CPU (host) code. When kernels are launched, a **grid** of **blocks** is created. We can pass in the number of **blocks**, and the number of **threads** per **block** (similar to function arguments).\n",

    "\n",
