# Intro
Let's not kid ourselves, if you ever thought about doing computer science, it's probably for one or two reasons. The first, you heard there's a massive amount of money in the industry, or the second you're a massive nerd.

Now, if you fit in both categories, like me, I have great news for you. Writing Kernels for performance programming by leveraging GPU's architechture, is where the moneys going to be. Why you may ask? 
Two reasons:
1. *"It's not enough to write good code anymore, Perfomance programming is where you need to be"* - Arvinddh
    - The reason being the saturated market of software developers, as well as the emergence of AI
    - Realistically, a lot of programmers will be replaced by AI in the near future, simply because of efficiency, and output.
        - Basically A.I can write code faster, and better than you. So Goodluck trying to be a software developer
2. Writing kernel functions is a niche
    - Why? Because it's hard
        - Writing basic kernel functions that use our GPU to perform computations isn't too demanding
        - However, writing Kernel functions that aim to optimize GPU's throughput, is where it get's tricky
        - Because it's such a niche, it's in high demand

# Significance

So what does this mean for you? If you like taking on challenges, and you like money, then you're in luck.
