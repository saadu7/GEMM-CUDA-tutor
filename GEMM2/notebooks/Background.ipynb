    "- Any given computation has a certain number of FLOPs that need to be performed. For example, if you want to multiply a M by K matrix with a K by N matrix we need to perform $2 * M * N * K$ FLOPs.\n",
    "    - For each pair $(i, j)$ you do K multiplies, and K - 1 adds $\\approx{2K FLOPS}$. 1 FLOP(Floating point operation) for multiply + 1 FLOP for addition\n",
    "    - There are M * N outputs, so total $FLOPs \\approx{(M N) * (2K)} ={2*M*N*K}$\n",
    "- The more FLOPs/sec our algorithm can achieve, the faster we can get the matrix multiplication done.\n",
    "- The roofline model gives us an upper bound on the FLOPs/sec we can achieve, subject to $\\tau$ and $\\beta$ which are fixed properties of our hardware.\n",
    "    - $\\tau$ (tau) = the **peak compute throughput** of your device for a given datatype/op (e.g **FP32** (Floating Point 32-bit float), **FP16/Tensor**)\n",
    "        - $\\tau$ is typically a large number. For example, for the T4 GPU, $\\tau$= 65,000,000,000,000 FLOPs/second. Units: FLOP/s -> 65 TFLOPs/second -> Tera FLOPs = $10^9$ FLOPs\n",
    "    - $\\beta$ (beta) = the **peak sustained memory bandwidth** between a given memory level and the cores (e.g., DRAM <-> SM). Units: bytes/s\n",
    "- We will refer to achieved FLOPs/sec as $T$ for throughput, and the upper bound on $T$ as $T_{max}$\n",
    "- The maximum FLOP/sec we can achieve ($T_{max}$) is modeled as a function of a variable called *computational intensity* ($I$), this is a property of the algorithm we will write.\n",
    "    - *Computational Intensity*: FLOPs done per byte moved between that memory level and the cores (reads + writes).\n",
    "        - Units: FLOP/byte\n",
    "- This metric measures the \"data reuse\" of our algorithm\n",
    "    - For each byte moved from slow memory to fast memory, how many FLOPs do we perform on it.\n",
    "- The roofline model says the upper bound on FLOPs/sec, ($T_{max}$), we can achieve, is the minimum of our computational intensity times memory bandwidth, and the peak floating point throughput of our hardware\n",

    "        - When $\\tau$ is our limiting factor we are *compute-bound*, this is a great place to be.\n",
    "    - $T_{max}$ may also be limited by our memory bandwidth times the computational intensity of our algorithm. If $\\tau$ were infinite, the achieved floating point throughput would simply be the number of bytes/sec being moved into fast memory, times the number of FLOPs performed per byte moved $\\beta * I$\n",
    "        - When we multiply $\\beta$ and $I$, the units cancel out to give FLOP/sec.\n",
    "            - $(bytes/s) *(FLOP/bytes) ={FLOP/s}$\n",
    "        - If $\\beta * I <{\\tau}$, or $I <{\\tau/\\beta}$ then we are *memory-bound*, meaning we are limited by how fast we can feed our compute units.\n",

    "    - Why do we try to increase $I$ and not our bandwidth?\n",
    "        - Since $\\tau$ and $\\beta$ are limited (they are fixed by hardware), we increase $I$ in order to become compute-bound. \n",
    "            - Otherwise, we would have to change to hardware with higher bandwidth.\n",
    "            - Additionaly this approach is better because if our algorithm can maximize *computational intensity* on hardware with less bandwidth then it will perform better on new hardware than an algorithm that doesn't maximize *computational intensity*.\n",
    "- How do we maximize *computational intensity*?\n",
    "    - In practice, this means moving a chunk of data from slow memory to fast memory, and then performing as many useful operations on it as allowed by our algorithm.\n",
    "    - Maximizing the amount of operations on a chunk of data, means we use that data until it won't be used in an operation again. I.e after we fetch it the first time, we won't fetch it again.\n",
    "    - As a result, we reduce the number of trips to slow memory, and now our performance depends on how many operations we can perform on each byte that is moved into fast memory -> we are **compute-bound**\n",

    "    - **Fast memory** (shared memory in the SM) is physically close to the compute units.\n",
