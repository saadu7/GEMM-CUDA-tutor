    "- Every few years the number of transistors on a microchip increases, and as a result the capacity for performing arithmetic operations has increased exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A **transistor** is a tiny electronic switch — the basic “work unit” of digital logic and memory. Modern CPUs and GPUs have billions of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - More transistors enable more logic gates, memory cells, and specialized units → greater parallelism, higher throughput, and more complex computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, data movement capacity (memory bandwidth) hasn’t increased as fast, creating the **memory wall** — a key bottleneck in deep learning and Tensor Core workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hence if we want to fully utilize Tensor Cores, we must increase the number of bytes moved between DRAM and compute units."
