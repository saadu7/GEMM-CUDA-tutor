    "- The maximum FLOP/sec we can achieve ($T_{max}$) is modeled as a function of a variable called *computational intensity* ($I$), this is a property of the algorithm we will write.\n",
    "    - *Computational Intensity*: FLOPs done per byte moved between that memory level and the cores (reads + writes).\n",
    "        - Units: FLOP/byte\n",
    "- This metric measures the \"data reuse\" of our algorithm\n",
    "    - For each byte moved from slow memory to fast memory, how many FLOPs do we perform on it.\n",

    "    - $T_{max}$ may also be limited by our memory bandwidth times the computational intensity of our algorithm. If $\\tau$ were infinite, the achieved floating point throughput would simply be the number of bytes/sec being moved into fast memory, times the number of FLOPs performed per byte moved $\\beta * I$\n",

    "    - In practice, this means moving a chunk of data from slow memory to fast memory, and then performing as many useful operations on it as allowed by our algorithm.\n",
    "    - Maximizing the amount of operations on a chunk of data, means we use that data until it won't be used in an operation again. I.e after we fetch it the first time, we won't fetch it again.\n",

    "- The achieved arithmetic intensity, together with our machine parameters $\\tau$ (peak compute throughput) and $\\beta$ (memory bandwidth), determines whether we are memory-bound or compute-bound.  \n",
    "- If the algorithm’s upper bound on arithmetic intensity allows it, we should optimize our kernel to approach that bound so that it becomes compute-bound rather than memory-bound.  \n",
